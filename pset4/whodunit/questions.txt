1.  stdint.h allows the usage of more specific integer widths
2.  These create integers of particular byte sizes (non-negative if they are unsigned)
3.  BYTE: 1, DWORD: 4, LONG: 4, WORD: 2
4.  42 4d
5.  bfSize: size of file, biSize: size of image
6.  If biHeight is negative, the image will be top-down if uncompressed
7.  biBitCount
8.  A file either might not exist (if reading it), or it might not be able to be written to (if permissions aren't possessed)
9.  It indicates the number of blocks of bytes to be read in. If it's 1 block, then 1 block of n bytes will be read in.
